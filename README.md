# Lights Off

Explore a dark, procedurally seeded map, find scattered keys, deliver them to the goal zone, and escape — all while evading a relentless entity. Collect glowing orbs to power up abilities that help you survive and navigate.

---

## Goal

* **Explore** the map.
* **Find keys** scattered around.
* **Deliver keys** to the **zone**.
* **Escape** once delivery is complete.
* **Avoid the entity** hunting you.
* **Collect orbs** to charge abilities.

---

## Quick Start

1. **New run:** Press `n`, type a **numeric seed**, then press `s` to start.
2. **Move** with `WASD`.
3. **Gather keys** (`j`) and **deliver** them to the zone.
4. **Use abilities** powered by orbs (`k`, `m`).
5. **Save** (`v`) and **load** (`l`) anytime; **restart** with `r`.

> Tip: Because runs are seeded, sharing the same seed reproduces the same layout.

## Orbs & Abilities

Collect orbs scattered through the map. Orbs fuel special abilities:

* **Dash (`k`)** — Burst of speed to escape danger or cross gaps.
* **Teleport (`m`)** — Short-range relocate to reposition or bypass hazards.
* **Lights (`z`)** — Reveal surroundings or conserve visibility for stealth.

---

## The Entity

A hostile entity roams the map:

* Use **dash/teleport** to break chase.
* The **entity path** view (`x`) can help you plan routes (if enabled).

---

## Saving & Loading

* **Save (`v`)** at any time.
* **Load (`l`)** to resume the last save (or start if none exists).
* **Restart (`r`)** to begin the current seed fresh.

> Pro tip: Save before risky moves or puzzles; restart to iterate faster on routes.
